        <h2>World Famous Hamburger</h2>
        <p>It's that time of the year again when everyone is outside having fun together, whether it's in your backyard or at the lake. You can never go wrong with some delicious burgers to make the day even better.</p>
        <p>This juice meaty hamburger will make the moments even more memorable. Jam packed with flavor, savory beef patty topped with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. All nested within two toasted buns.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Beef:</strong> These burgers start with 1.5 pounds of lean ground beef.</li>
            <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> A finely chopped onion takes the flavor up a notch. Some romane lettuce, slices of tomatoes, and two dices of dill pickle.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> American cheese is the perfect cheese for any burger.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg:</strong> To help bind the patties better.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> You want to get a nice blend of onion powder, black pepper, salt, garlic powder, dried basil, dried parsely, dried basil, and oregano.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a bowl to crack your egg and whisk it. Grab your ground beef and start making 2 pound balls. We'll use two pounds since you'll lose some weight on your beef as you cook it. Heat up a pan with a little bit of oil, press down on your beef balls to make a patty and egg wash the patty before you put it on the pan.</li>
            <li>As the patties are cooking, 15 minutes on each side, finely chop an onion and start mixing your spices together to make the seasoning.</li>
            <li>Once you flip the patties, add your seasoning on top of the patty followed by your chopped onions. Once the other side has been cooked for 15 minutes, flip it back for another 5 minutes to let the seasoning and onions infuse their flavor into the patties.</li>
            <li>Take your burger buns and toast them on both sides, add any condiments that you want. Get your buns and start to layer the patty with a leaf of lettuce, burger patty, cheese, two slices of tomatoes, 2 dices of dill pickle, and top it off with the top bun with your preferred condiments spread on it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have made our world famous burger, now you're a master of the grill and will be the life of the party everytime you bring out the grill. <br>Enjoy!</p>
