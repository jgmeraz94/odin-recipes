            <li><strong>Meat:</strong> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
            <li><strong>Onion and Garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Tomato products:</strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsely, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Lasagna pasta:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna pasta.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cooking Instructions Step-by-Step</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a pan and start cooking the meat until its nice and brown. As you're cooking the meat, prepare your tomato sauce by chopping half an onion and mincing two garlic cloves. Once the suace is prepped add to meat and cook for 5 minutes. Don't cook the meat sauce all the way since it will get over cooked once it's baking in the oven.</li>
            <li>Get a pot and add enough water to be able to cover the lasagna pasta. As you prep the pot to boil the water, add a dash of salt into the water before boiling. Boil the water and let your pasta cook for 10 minutes until it is al dente. After it's done, strain the pasta and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Next you will make the ricotta mixture. Grab one whole large egg and your ricotta cheese and mix both in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Grab an oven safe baking dish and start layering your lasagna. First add the meat sauce, then the pasta, the ricotta mixture, mozarella slices, meat sauce, and parmesan cheese. Repeat the layering instructions until you've used it all.</li>
            <li>Cover the lasagna with foil and bake in the oven at 450Â°F for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once done, let the lasagna rest for 5 minutes and then enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
